# ML-Lab

## Description
Lab-ML is a repository designed for learning and implementing classification models using the Python programming language with Keras and TensorFlow, optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. It is aimed at exploring various classification techniques ranging from simple logistic regression to complex neural networks. With ML-Lab, users can build, train, and test models, gaining hands-on experience with real-world datasets and cutting-edge technology.

## Motivation
- **Advance in Machine Learning**: Dive deep into classification problems using advanced frameworks and GPU acceleration.
- **Hands-On Experience**: Gain practical experience by running complex models and experiments.
- **Optimize Performance**: Learn how to leverage NVIDIA GPUs for faster computation and model training.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- An NVIDIA GPU with the latest driver installed
- CUDA and cuDNN libraries for GPU support

### Installing
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install TensorFlow with GPU support by following the instructions at [TensorFlow Installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install).
3. Install Keras using pip: `pip install keras`.
4. Ensure your NVIDIA GPU drivers are up to date, along with CUDA and cuDNN libraries.

### Executing Programs
1. Activate your Python environment if you are using virtualenv or conda.
2. Run your script with Python: `python path/to/your_script.py`.
3. Utilize your GPU's power by making sure your scripts are written to leverage TensorFlow's GPU capabilities.

## Help
